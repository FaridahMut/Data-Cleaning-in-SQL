# Project Title: Data cleaning in SQL

**Data set** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

## Introduction
In today's dynamic economic landscape, payoffs represent a significant aspect of workforce dysnamics across various industries and regions.
This project aims to look into a dataset titled **layoffs**, containing information on the number of people laid off across the world and within different companies and industries. The dataset consists of Tech layoff from COVID 2019 that is 11th March to April 2024.
Through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), I seek to gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns associated with layoffs. 

## Objectives
1. Data Cleaning
   * Removing duplicates: By removing any redundant entries to main the integrity of the data
   * Standardizing the data: Identifying any issues and fixing them e.g, Converting data types for numerical analysis
   * Removing/handling NULL and Blank Values
   * Removing any unnecessary columns
2. Exploratory Data Analyis
  This is done in a different project in my repository.(https://github.com/FaridahMut/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-SQL)
